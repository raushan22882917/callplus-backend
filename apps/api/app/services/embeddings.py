"""Turning text into vectors, and into the stemmed terms retrieval compares.

The built-in embedder hashes word and word-pair features into 384 numbers. It
needs no key and no network, is deterministic, and is as good as the words
the question and the passage share; the synonym expansion below is what lets
"cost" find "price". An external embeddings API can implement the same
`Embedder` interface later without touching retrieval."""
